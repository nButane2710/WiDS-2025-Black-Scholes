# Black–Scholes Option Pricing – WiDS Project

This repository contains all the code developed by me as part of the WiDS Winter Project on the Black–Scholes option pricing model.  
This repository includes all implementations created during the course along with this README file.

The project begins with the analytical Black–Scholes formula for pricing European call and put options and extends to the computation of option Greeks such as Delta, Gamma, and Vega.  
In addition to closed-form solutions, Monte Carlo simulations are implemented to numerically estimate option prices and study convergence behavior.

This repository also includes an implementation of implied volatility estimation using numerical root-finding methods, as well as parameter sweep experiments to analyze the effect of volatility and time to maturity on option prices and sensitivities.  
A detailed PDF report accompanies this repository, documenting the theory, experiments, and learnings over the duration of the WiDS program.
