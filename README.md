# WiDS'2025 - Black-Scholes Model – Midterm Submission

This repository contains my initial work for the WiDS'2025 Course on Black–Scholes Models.
I went through the theoretical derivation of the Black–Scholes formula and implemented
the pricing of European call and put options using Python.
I also implemented basic Greeks such as Delta, Gamma, and Vega.
This repository serves as my midterm submission, and I plan to extend it further
with numerical methods and deeper analysis in the coming weeks.
